The purpose of this project is to be able to monitor our FRC batteries using RFID tags to track the data from charging and competition.

There will be 2 different stations. The first is the charging station which will charge the batteries to full capacity.
The second station will be to check the battery before and after placing it in the robot. It will only see current charge stats for the battery and upload that to the spreadsheet.

Main device is a RaspberryPi using RFID tag readers that read RFID tags placed on our batteries. 
The tag reader will read the tag and then track the progress of the batteries charging rate.
This information will be sent to a spreadsheet that can be viewed at any time.
The Raspberry Pi will be able to review that data in order to select which battery should be used for our next match
