The purpose of this project is to be able to monitor our FRC batteries using RFID tags to track the data from charging and competition.

There will be 2 different stations. The first is the charging station which will charge the batteries to full capacity.
The second station will be to check the battery before and after placing it in the robot. It will only see current charge stats for the battery and upload that to the spreadsheet.

Main device is a RaspberryPi using RFID tag readers that read RFID tags placed on our batteries. 
The tag reader will read the tag and then track the progress of the batteries charging rate.
This information will be sent to a spreadsheet that can be viewed at any time.
The Raspberry Pi will be able to review that data in order to select which battery should be used for our next match

######################CURRENT ESTIMATED PARTS LIST######################
### **Core Components:**
1. **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB or 8GB RAM)**  
   - Acts as the central controller for reading RFID data, logging voltage, and updating Google Sheets.  
   - Alternative: BeagleBone Black or Jetson Nano (if more GPIO is needed).  

2. **RFID Readers (6x, one per battery slot)**  
   - **RC522 RFID Module** (cheap and widely supported).  
   - Alternative: **PN532 NFC Module** (supports more tag formats).  

3. **RFID Tags (One per battery)**  
   - Passive 13.56MHz RFID tags (stickers or key fobs).  

### **Voltage Monitoring:**
4. **Voltage & Current Sensors (6x, one per battery slot)**  
   - **INA219 (I2C) or INA226** for precise voltage and current readings.  
   - Alternative: **ACS758 (Hall effect sensor)** if you need higher current measurement.  

5. **Multiplexer (if using I2C sensors)**  
   - **TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer** (needed to handle multiple I2C sensors on the same bus).  

### **Charging & Power Components:**
6. **Battery Chargers (6x, one per slot)**  
   - **NOCO Genius10 or AM-2105 (AndyMark FRC Charger)**  
   - Supports FRC 12V lead-acid batteries safely.  

7. **12V Power Supply (for Pi & RFID readers)**  
   - **5V 3A USB-C Power Adapter** for Raspberry Pi.  
   - **12V DC power supply** for other components (RFID, sensors).  
   - Optional: **DC-DC Buck Converter (12V to 5V)** for efficient power regulation.  

### **Data & Display:**
8. **OLED or LCD Display (Optional)**  
   - **Waveshare 1.3" OLED Display (SPI/I2C)** to show real-time battery status.  

9. **WiFi or Ethernet Connectivity**  
   - **Raspberry Pi has built-in WiFi**, but you can add a USB-to-Ethernet adapter if needed for stability.  

### **Relay Module (Optional - for Automated Charging Control)**  
10. **8-Channel Relay Module (5V logic)**  
   - Can be used to cut power to a charger if voltage reaches a certain threshold.  

### **Miscellaneous Components:**
11. **Jumper Wires, Breadboard, PCB or Perfboard**  
   - For wiring and prototyping before finalizing the circuit.  

12. **Enclosure (Optional)**  
   - A custom enclosure to house the Pi, sensors, and wiring neatly.
